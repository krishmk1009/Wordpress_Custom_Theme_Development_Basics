-------------------------------------------------------------------
To create a WordPress menu area function, you can use the built-in register_nav_menus() function in your theme's functions.php file. This function allows you to register multiple navigation menus, which can be used in different locations throughout your WordPress theme.




step by step creation of the theme development :


1. create the folder structure, add some files , explain the template heirarchi...
2.use the template files from the github, front-page to home page
3. use the wp_load , enuque style and also add custom styles links and then remove all those links , check in the source code,
4. same for the js scripts
5. now divide the code in footer and header and render it using get_headder() , get_footer();
6. now render the title dynamically.... remove the hardocded title from the html , and add in function.php using a function =  add_theme_support("title-tag"); , and hook is =after_setup_theme;

7.now wp loop and pull the content from the database , delete all the hardcode html , create a page -add the content in it, make it static homne page and in the front-page check using this
<?php
    if (have_posts()) {

        while (have_posts()) {
            the_post();
            the_content();
        }
     ?>

this will render the content for the website, also we can render the page title dnamically using the_title() method.


8. Now next step is to create a navbar dynamically , so firstly create a function in the function.php which is register_nav_menus($locations) -- location is a array which takes the bunch of locations of different menus like primary ,footer .wrap it in a function and and hook init, now you can see theese menu options in the menu in wordpress admin dashiboard.

now to render it in the actual page , use wp_nav_menu , it takes array and array takes a bunch of arguments , you can also apply custom style using the walker which is adavance options, but for now lets see the basic as follwing:

wp_nav_menu(
    array(
        "menu" => "primary",
        "container" => "",
        "theme_location" => "primary",
        "items_wrap" => '<ul id="" class="navbar-nav flex-column text-sm-center text-md-left">%3$s</ul>',
    )
    );



9. how to render the dynamic custom logo:

10.  get_bloginfo("name") , dynamic site name rendering
 

11 . post page - single.php

add some post  , to enable featured images add the post-thumbnails in the add_theme_support.
now after visiting the post we cant see anything , just because we have not setup our single.php page, so just copy the front-page.php code and paste in it and now we can see the post and its content.   

make the template-parts dir and inside that add the content.php file which will render our content , and add get_template_parts("slug" , article); in the single.php

comments_number() , the_date() , the_tags() , we can also customize the tags by passing some args . before all this things just copy the code ffrom the template for the reffernce
